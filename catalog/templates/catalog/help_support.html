                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                            You can browse products from various wholesalers, add them to your cart, and place a booking order without any upfront payment. The wholesaler will then review your order, add shipping and GST charges, and send you a final invoice. Once you receive the invoice, you can make a secure payment through our platform.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                            Yes. We use Razorpay, a trusted payment gateway, for all transactions. Your payment is held in escrow, meaning we hold the funds securely and only release them to the wholesaler after your order has been shipped. This protects you from fraud.

                        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                            You can view the status of all your orders in the "My Orders" section of your profile. Once an order is shipped, the wholesaler will upload a tracking ID and courier details, which you can view on the order detail page.

                            We offer a 24-hour window for return or replacement requests, starting from the time your order is marked as delivered. If you receive a damaged or incorrect item, please contact our support team via WhatsApp within 24 hours. You will be required to provide photos of the product as evidence. All return and replacement requests are handled manually by our team to ensure a fair resolution.

                            After a retailer pays for a confirmed order, the funds are held securely by us. Once you ship the order and update the status, the funds will be released to the bank account you have registered in your profile.

                            We charge a small commission on each successful order. This fee helps us maintain the platform, process payments securely, and attract more retailers to your products. For detailed information on our commission structure, please contact us.
